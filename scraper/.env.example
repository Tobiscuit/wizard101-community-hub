# Path to your Firebase Service Account JSON file (if using a file)
# OR the raw JSON content (if pasting directly, though file path is recommended for Python)
# For this script, we expect the JSON content string if using the current code, 
# BUT standard practice is often a path. 
# Let's stick to the code's expectation: The content of the JSON file.
# However, pasting a huge JSON string into .env can be messy.
# A better approach for local dev is to point to the file path.
# Let's update the script to handle a file path too, but for now, let's assume they paste the JSON.
