# 🏰 Dev Log: Converting "Pet Tome" into "The Commons"

Hey everyone! 👋 We've been hard at work refactoring the app into a true Community Hub. Here is a sneak peek at what we built today. We need your feedback!

## 1. Profiles 2.0 (The New Commons)
We moved away from a simple calculator to full **User Profiles**.
*   **The Wizard Gallery**: You can now add *all* your wizards (Main + Alts) to your profile.
*   **Event Ready**: Mark your wizard as **"Friendly"** to opt-in for event pings (e.g., "Mass Darkmoor Run"). Only those with this flag toggled will get the notification!
*   **The Pet Tome**: A visual grid of your pets. We added a **"Carried By"** indicator so you know exactly which wizard is holding that *Spark Beast*.

## 2. The New "Trust Score" 🛡️
We want to prevent scams without needing 24/7 moderation. Introducing the **Composite Trust System**:
Your "Trust Badge" is now a sum of three scores:
1.  **Hatch Reputation**: Points for verified pure hatches (Logarithmic curve included).
2.  **Market Score**: (Future) Points for successful Empower/Elixir trades.
3.  **Vouches**: Community Reviews (Stars, Tags, or Thumbs Up).

*Safety Feature*: We built a **"Connection Draining"** system. If we need to close the market, active trades get 15 minutes to finish safely before the doors lock.

## 3. "The Yearly Scroll" (Analytics) 📜
We're tracking fun stats for a "Spotify Wrapped" style experience:
*   **Gold Saved**: We estimate how much Gold you saved by hatching here vs the Kiosk (e.g., *"You saved ~4.5m Gold this year!"*).
*   **Generosity**: Tracks how many Packs or Elixirs you've gifted.
*   **Top Partner**: Shows who you hatch with the most (e.g., *"You and Wolf StormBlade are inseparable"*).

## 4. Technical Updates ⚙️
*   **Level 180 Ready**: The system is aware of the new Level 180 cap and Darkmoor updates.
*   **Solarized Themes**: New "Abyss" (Dark) and "Solarized" (Light) themes that are easier on the eyes.

### 🧠 Feedback Needed:
1.  **Level 180 Mechanics**: Can anyone confirm if the hatching slot cap increased at Level 180? Or is it still 4?
2.  **Vouch System**: How should reviews work? **5-Star Ratings** 🌟? **Wizard Tags** (e.g., "Patient", "Fast")? Or just **Thumbs Up** 👍?
3.  **Pet Grid**: We added a green **"Lending"** badge for pets available to hatch. Is that clear enough?
4.  **Analytics**: What other fun stats should we track? (Items Traded? Most Common Pet Body?)
